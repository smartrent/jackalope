  Start a Jackalope session

  This will start a supervised group of processes; part of the group
  will keep track of the topic filter subscription state, and hold a
  list of yet to be published messages, as well as the requested
  subscription changes; the other part of the process tree will keep
  the MQTT connection specific parts, making sure we got a
  connection. See the main documentation on the `Jackalope` module for
  more information on the process architecture.

  `Jackalope.start_link/1` takes a keyword list containing option
  values, that configure the instance, as an argument. The available
  options and their defaults are:

  - `client_id` (default: "jackalope"), string that will be used as
    the client_id of the MQTT connection; see `t Tortoise.client_id`
    for more information on valid client ids. Notice that the
    client_id needs to be unique on the server, so two clients may not
    have the same client_id.

  - `initial_topics` (optional) specifies a list of topic_filters
    Jackalope should connect to when a connection has been
    established. Notice that this list is only used for the initial
    connect, should a reconnect happen later in the life-cycle, the
    current subscription state tracked by Jackalope will be used.

  - `handler` (default: `Jackalope.Handler.Logger`) specifies the
    module implementing the callbacks (implementing
    `Jackalope.Handler` behaviour) to use. This is where you can
    configure how Jackalope reacts to events in the connection
    life-cycle, including what to do when receiving a message on a
    subscribed topic filter; read the documentation for
    `Jackalope.Handler` for more information on the events and
    callbacks.

  - `server` (default: #{inspect(@default_mqtt_server)}) specifies the
    connection type, and its options, to use when connecting to the
    MQTT server. The default specification will attempt to connect to
    a broker running on localhost:1883, on an unsecure
    connection. This value should only be used for testing and
    development;.

  - `last_will` (default: nil) specifies the last will message that
    should get published on the MQTT broker if the connection is
    closed or dropped unexpectedly. If we want to specify a last will
    topic we should define a keyword list containing the following:

      - `topic` (Required) the topic to post the last will message to;
        this should be specified as a string and it should be a valid
        MQTT topic; consult `t Tortoise.topic` for more info on valid
        MQTT topics.

      - `payload` (default: nil) the payload of the last will message;
        notice that we will attempt to JSON encode the payload term
        (unless it is nil), so it will fail if the data fails the JSON
        encode.

      - `qos` (default: 0) either 0 or 1, denoting the quality of
        service the last will message should get published with; note
        that QoS=2 is not supported by AWS IoT.

  - TODO `backoff` make backoff a configurable value
